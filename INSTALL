REQUIREMENTS:
 - FUSE 2.* (tested with FUSE 2.3 and newer)
 - Python 2.3 or newer (tested with 2.4, but should work with 2.3;
   even 2.2 should be possible to use with some additonal imports
   [Optik/optparse, generators from future])
 - pkg-config [http://pkgconfig.freedesktop.org/]

INSTALLATION:
The best way to install this python FUSE module is:
 1. Type 'python setup.py build'. (If you have FUSE installed at a
    non-standard location, adjust the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
    accordingly.)
 2. You might try xmp.py, the example filesystem. Just link
    build/lib.*/_fusemodule.so to the top of the source tree and
    see what "python xmp.py -h" gives.
 3. If all has gone ok, become root and type 'python setup.py install'.

That way, the FUSE python modules will be built against the correct version
of python and installed in your system-wide python directory. This will allow
your filesystem script to find them, no matter where it's residing.

WARNING:
We have altered from the original FUSE Python API in non-compatible
ways. See README.new_fusepy_api how can you get running a fs which is
written against the original API.
