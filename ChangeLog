	* Add some missing Py_DECREF-s.
	* Make compat layer side effect free, fix bailing out upon
          the lack of optional stat fields.
	* Fix stat/offset integer overflows.
	  Based on patch from Michael Cohen.

2006-05-28  Csaba Henk <csaba.henk@creo.hu>
	* Add support for st_rdev, st_blksize, st_block stat fields.
	  Noticed by Robert Bradford.
	* Switch getattr / statfs to an object oriented interface:
	   - Revert the addition of the statvfs method.
	   - Implement compat conversion for old getattr / statfs
	     results.

2006-05-27  Csaba Henk <csaba.henk@creo.hu>
	* setup.py related fixes:
	   - fix missing installation of fuse.py
	   - fix typo in reference to shout-py  
	   - define __version__ in a way so that it's visible both in
	     fuse.py and setup.py
	* NEW PYTHON API:
	   - Python/C interface trimmed further: we pass down the opvector,
	     the argument vector and the multithreaded flag, period.
	   - Generate FUSE commandline from FuseArgs instance.
	   - Add optparse based parsing API with support for extracting
	     FUSE related options to a FuseArgs instance.
	   - Update xmp.py to the new API, enhance it with a "-o root=PATH"
	     option.
	   - Add compat hooks (python variable, environment variable).
	   - Document these changes in README.new_fusepy_api.
	   - bump __version__ to 0.2pre1.
           - add os.statvfs() compatible statvfs method, mark statfs
             deprecated, keep statfs useable via statfs -> statvfs conversion

2006-05-24  Csaba Henk <csaba.henk@creo.hu>
	* Revamp fs initialization code:
	   - Get rid of both of the kopts/lopts and the fuse_opt stuff,
	     just keep opts in a dict and assemble a simple argc/argv pair
	     from that. This means that for all supported API versions we can
	     get away with the fuse_setup() / *fuse_loop*() / fuse_teardown()
	     call sequence. This is much more clean and correct than the
	     earlier approaches, and differenciating between APIs boils down
	     to differenciating between the exact form of the above routines.
	   - Properly catch and propagate errors.
	   - Add crude support for fetching options from command line to xmp.py.
	* Syntax cleanup:
	   - Strip leo markup. I'm not using leo and I find that markup somewhat
	     obtrusive. OTOH it seems to be auto-generated so my editions will
	     break it anyway.
	   - Fix indetation, uniformize look.

2006-05-23  Csaba Henk <csaba.henk@creo.hu>
	* Fix statfs index mismatch in xmp.py:
	* Rebase build system on pkg-config:
	   - Credits: setup.py based on that of shout-python (python bindings to
	     libshout, part of the icecast project)
	* Update code so that it can be compiled against FUSE libs with API from
	  21 to 26:
	   - Credits: aggregated from contributions, code snippets and ideas of
	     Simon Barner, Csaba Henk, Roman Shterenzon and Miklos Szeredi
	* Result of argument type check was ignored in FuseInvalidate(), fix
	  it

2006-02-03  Sebastien Delafond <sdelafond@gmx.net>
  
	* Removed unnecessary "st->st_ino = 0" line in _fusemodule.c.
	* Added __init__ argument handling in fuse.py. Command-line 
	  arguments still take precedence over contructor ones.
	* Removed unused os module from fuse.py.
	* Changed  def read(self, path, length, offset) to 
	  def read(self, path, length, offset) so that len() can be
	  used inside read().

2005-04-07  Sebastien Delafond <sdelafond@gmx.net>

	* Added support for statfs.f_bavail, so that df can correctly report
	  disk usage.
	
2004-11-21  Sebastien Delafond <sdelafond@gmx.net>	

	* Took over maintainership.
	* Added comment to xmp.py
	
2004-09-27  Miklos Szeredi <miklos@szeredi.hu>

	* Applied patch by Steven James.  The Python binding in the CVS
	  version fell out of date and wouldn't compile. Fixed and added
	  FuseGetContext call.
